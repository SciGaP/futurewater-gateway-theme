                    <p>Computations are done by water resource experts and scholar collaborators. Our hydrological data and model source codes will be hosted on
                    IU’s exceptional High-Performance Computing cyberinfrastructure. Collaborators can either run their own models by modifying the input
                    files or mine the huge catches of modeling output files stored on Big Red II and analyze the data to answer questions related to their own disciplines.
                       These models could become research infrastructure for student dissertation research across schools and disciplines with
                       downstream applications, for instances of flood frequency forecasting, social-economic modeling, and animal migrations. We
                       envision a near future where our models and gateway, once fully developed, become a platform for future research collaboration and
                       service toward better management of water quantity and water quality in Indiana.

                <h2>Future Water Project is ....</h2>
                <p>
                To better assess water resources availability in the future, we used the USDA Soil-Water Assessment Tool software package and climate
                projections from an ensemble of 10 global climate models (GCMs) to simulate climate change impacts on the water cycles in the Wabash River Basin,
                which covers most of Indiana. Our computer simulations predicted the water cycles to the year 2100 under
                two IPCC CO2 emission scenarios: RCP 4.5 and 8.5, representing a medium- and high-emissions scenario, respectively.
                </p>

                <p>
                Successful management of water resources requires us all not only to put the best sciences into our
                forecasts but also to change the ways that scientific results are communicated. We have endeavored to make the model and modeling
                results accessible to scholar collaborators and  policy makers, and the public. Please visit the two tabs below respectively.
